# @choksheak/ts-utils

This package is a random bunch of Typescript utilities that I have needed in almost every project that I have worked in. Hence making an easy way to share this code and also for my own personal and professional use. Feel free to use it in your own projects without any restrictions.

The code supports full tree-shaking. Therefore your code will only grow in size by whatever you use. Any code that you are not using will not contribute to your code size.
