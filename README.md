# @choksheak/ts-utils

This package is a time-tested collection of Typescript utilities that I have
personally needed in almost every project that I have worked in. Making this an
open source, public npm package allows me to share this code freely with others
as well as using it for my own personal and professional projects. Feel free to
use it in your own projects without any restrictions.

The code supports full tree-shaking. Therefore your code will only grow in size
by whatever you use. Any code that you are not using will not contribute to
your code size.
